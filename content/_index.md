# A little about professional me

I develop systems and tools that make life easier. I mostly work with Rust & Python but sometimes Kotlin, Java and JavaScript sneaks in here and there.

# A little about regular me

Outside programming, I am particular about how I brew my tea and coffee. I regularly run and go for devastating bicycle ride as if Ankara is as flat as a pancake without hostile stray dogs camping every street.

# About the blog

You will find articles about my projects once they are completed. I also plan to add a recipes section when I find enough good recipes.
