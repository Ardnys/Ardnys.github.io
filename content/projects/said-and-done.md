# Said & Done

Name of the projects tries to convey my motivation for this project, which is to create journals just by talking about your day. I also added extra features like suggestions or reminders for the next day, and more to come.

This project is open source. If you are curious, [check out the repository here](https://github.com/Ardnys/SaidAndDone).
